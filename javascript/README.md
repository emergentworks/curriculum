# Javascript && Developer Mindset

### Objectives

We have split this milestone into 3 objectives:

  - [Objective A:  Be able to read and write basic Javascript or any other object-oriented programming language.](#objective-a--be-able-to-read-and-write-basic-javascript-or-any-other-object-oriented-programming-language)
  - [Objective B: Have a grasp on a healthy coding mentality.](#objective-b-have-a-grasp-on-a-healthy-coding-mentality)
  - [Objective C: Able to communicate their understanding of how modern web applications work in the industry.](#objective-c-able-to-communicate-their-understanding-of-how-modern-web-applications-work-in-the-industry)

There is one required activity to complete:
  - [Chat Bot](chat-bot.md)

#### How to navigate these objectives?

These three objectives are meant to be done in parallel with each other. However, Objective A and B have higher priority over Objective C.

Under each objective, there are side-quests and independent work that allows for additional activities outside of the chat bot project.

## Objective A:  Be able to read and write basic Javascript or any other object-oriented programming language.

We simply want to get started with reading and writing in a modern programming language. This is their foundation to future projects and opportunities so be sure to not rush this section. **This section is not intended to teach them everything about programming languages.** Instead, we want to ensure that they can confidently learn on their own in the future. The most important topics to cover:
* Mutability
* Types
* Arithmetic operators
* Conditional statements
* Arrays
* Functions
* Class and Objects

#### Side-Quest: Code Construction

This side quest simulates a program that calculates the cost of shipping a package. As the cost of shipping gets more complicated, this exercise introduces ways to tweak the program from using just for-loops to creating functions and classes. Link [here](https://gist.github.com/ashley/4c8300e9ef980af3e3966f41ebed3f95).

#### Side-Quest: Debug by hand

Let’s focus on managing states of different variables in our head by writing them out. Make a copy of this [word doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-701t2hRIREe-7UDSFvI4P6_fv2h0xQ8cxcH85a8MtM/edit?usp=sharing) and without running any code, complete the worksheet.

#### Side-Quest: Lyrics Repeater
This side quest is to help grasp the idea of analyzing strings by using arrays and objects. The end result should be:
1. Be able to pass in a body of text (lyrics) to a program.
2. Count the unique number of words used in the text.

This can be used to rate the uniqueness of a song or to create a word cloud. Check [Pudding’s article](https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/index.html) that sorted rappers by their vocabulary. There’s also [SongSim](https://colinmorris.github.io/SongSim/#/), a web app that shows the visualization of repeated words ([Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzzmqUoQobc) referenced).

#### Side-Quest: Learn to use jQuery

  * Gives an introduction to concepts like memoization, first-class functions, etc.

## Objective B: Have a grasp on a healthy coding mentality

Software engineers are well aware of the frustration and overwhelming feeling that comes with learning how to build software. This objective is meant to help guide mentees around the emotional learning that comes with learning to code. This section is not meant to be technical although we hope some of these topics can be taught while working on a Javascript project. We hope that this can be a time for mentors to be vulnerable and share ways to not feel impostered by endless amounts of knowledge. Here are the following topics that should be covered:

* Imposter Syndrome
  * What is it? How can it affect a person's coding experience? As a mentor, could you share some of your experiences with feeling imposter syndrome? [Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-imposter-syndrome-and-how-do-you-overcome-it/) is something that can be given a homework reading.
* Developer Mindset
  * Explain the flow of software creation. Other than writing code, there's also operation and matinence of the code. 
  * Introduce abstraction and pragmatic thinking. Helpful article [here](https://thevaluable.dev/abstraction-type-software-example/).
  * Discuss what are realistic timelines for building software. Help your mentee understand that software is usually not built overnight.
  * [Reading homework](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-fundamentals-of-a-good-developer-mindset-in-15-minutes-81321ab8a682/)
* Reading what you don’t understand
  * Explain how bad documentation impacts technology and software engineers.
  * What are some ways that your mentee can get better at reading and understanding documentation?
  * Activity: How does [this diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2825071/128613191-8cb3b6f6-9200-4e0f-abaf-060f32b69159.jpeg) make your mentee feel?
  * [Reading homework](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-read-your-way-to-becoming-a-better-developer-b6432fa5bc0c/)
* Overwhelming code
  * Break down ways to decipher code that feels overwhelming to read and understand.
  * Extra resource on [paralysis by analysis](https://daedtech.com/the-secret-to-avoiding-paralysis-by-analysis/).
* Pseudo code
  * Give an overview of how to communicate using pseudo code.
* Bugs and troubleshooting
  * Clarify to your mentee how long some bugs may take to solve and how it can impact someone's mental health. Helpful [article](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/06/08/reasons-why-bugs-might-feel-impossible/).
  * Come up with steps that your mentee can take when they are stuck. For example, they should spend x amount of time on a bug before asking for help from you.
* Software FOMO
  * Aware your mentee of being ok with not knowing everything in the current tech stack. Helpful [article](https://blog.glitch.com/post/ending-stack-anxiety)
* How to ask for help
  * Discuss strategies and and confidence in asking for technical help.

#### Side Quest: Review documentation

Have your mentee try a couple different tutorials. Have them explain which made sense and which didn’t.

#### Side Quest: Understanding www.

This side quest is meant to help the mentee identify when they might feel overwhelmed from learning about technology. You can start by showing them this diagram and asking them how much of the [diagram](https://dev.to/wassimchegham/ever-wondered-what-happens-when-you-type-in-a-url-in-an-address-bar-in-a-browser-3dob) is understood by a typical software engineer. The next part of this side-quest is to further simulate the overwhelming feeling of trying to learn about something unknown. Talk to your mentee about the content on [this page](https://github.com/joinpursuit/Pursuit-Core-Web/tree/master/html_css_dom/the_internet) as if you were explaining this to another engineer (this is an actual lesson plan from a bootcamp). This can take up to 30 minutes or more. Aftwards, discuss how your mentee felt throughout this activity. Some take-aways from this side-quest should be:
  * Clarify to your mentee that no one is an expert at everything about the web nor is that the expectation of an engineer.
  * Help your mentee identify when they felt lost in the material. Did they lose interest because of not having enough context around the topic? Were they pretending to understand something when in fact they didn't?
  * Help your mentee practice asking questions especially if they feel imposter synfrome from asking the same question multiple times.

## Objective C: Able to communicate their understanding of how modern web applications work in the industry

This objective is meant to help strengthen the way mentees understand and talk about technical topics. Without writing code, mentees should be able to communicate concepts like HTTP, asynchronous requests, databases, and APIs. This objective is also meant to learn more about the architecture design of software (with a focus on large-scale web applications).

Because this objective is meant to be flexible, here are some topics that can be covered:
* Abstraction
* Compilers, binary, and machine code
* HTTP and status codes
* Asynchronous computing (a great segway to Promises in Javascript)
* Intro to databases
* APIs and why there are so many of them
* Open-Source software
* Computer networks (TCP, UDP, etc.)
* Web security and why 2-factor authentication exists

#### Side-Quest: How to build X

Preparation: If you’re not familiar with distributed systems or doing architecture design, here are some resources that could help you feel prepared for this side quest.

Instructions: Use Excalidraw or Google Draw as a whiteboard to map out the architecture of a site that’s familiar to your mentee. For example, a subreddit, Instagram feed, bank app, or Youtube.
1. Start by drawing out a user. Ask the mentee:
	* What sort of things can a user do? For example, in Instagram, a user should be able to view photos, like and comment on photos, and upload photos.
	* What does the site need? Does it need an interface? Is it a phone app?
2. Start drawing out representations of a server to represent the application. Now ask:
	* What does the application include? For example, in Instagram, the application has to keep track of uploaded photos. It also needs to know the relationship between users and their followers. Don’t forget, we also need to keep track of account logins.
3. As you ask your mentee these questions, discuss how engineers building this existing application might solve these problems. This could mean outlining the schema for a database that keeps track of user information. You could also draw out different services like storage for photos (Instagram example) and how these services intend to interact with each other.
4. Additionally, discuss how a design might change if they decide to introduce a new feature. For example, in Instagram, they needed to incorporate videos and a messaging system. How do engineers build a feature around the current design?
5. Lastly, conclude that there are infinite ways this could be designed, but these are commonly the problems that engineers solve with code.

**Extra Credit**: Discuss this article that goes in-depth about Netflix’s scalability.
