# Curriculum

The Emergent Works curriculum is **a guide** that supports our mentors and students in their learning goals & development of their project.

Each student has different learning goals and each project is different so this curriculum is a resource that doesn’t aim to cover everything but rather serves as a jumping off point and something for our members to come back to when they need help.

Some mentorship pairs may be ready immediately to begin planning a final project, others may not advance that far through the program – you can use your first session to find out where in the curriculum to start.

This code of conduct applies to all Emergent Works spaces, including our classes, events, communications, and curriculum, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Core Team.

Some Emergent Works spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.
