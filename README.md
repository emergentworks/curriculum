# Emergent Works Curriculum

The Emergent Works curriculum is **a guide** that supports our mentors and students in their learning goals & development of their project.

Each student has different learning goals and each project is different so this curriculum is a resource that doesn’t aim to cover everything but rather serves as a jumping off point and something for our members to come back to when they need help.

Some mentorship pairs may be ready immediately to begin planning a final project, others may not advance that far through the program – you can use your first session to find out where in the curriculum to start.

## How to navigate this repository
