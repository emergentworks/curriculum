# Emergent Works Curriculum

## Description

The Emergent Works curriculum is **a guide** that supports our mentors and students in their learning goals & development of their project.

Each student has different learning goals and each project is different so this curriculum is a resource that doesn’t aim to cover everything but rather serves as a jumping off point and something for our members to come back to when they need help.

Some mentorship pairs may be ready immediately to begin planning a final project, others may not advance that far through the program – you can use your first session to find out where in the curriculum to start.

## Learning with this curriculum

The best way to work with this curriculum is to go through the following sections in order. As you advance through the curriculum, you will gain the skills needed to build a final project. The first section is intended to give inspiration around what that project could be.
