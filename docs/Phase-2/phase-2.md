# Phase 2 - Web Fundamentals

This is EW's Phase 2 Mentee Curriculum during the 12 weeks mentorship.
Phase 2 consists of 3 Modules, with each module being 4 weeks.

During the mentorship, the mentor is expected to utilize the Phase 2 curriculum and
adjust the pace of it according to their mentee's needs.

In the curriculum, the mentor will find hyperlinked resources that they can use.

Mentors will also be provided with a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zxx33pMIud3dbVyI-OS6yUb64AkhTxDSpJbNCj7lftE/edit" target="_blank">lesson plan template</a> that can be used to structure each lesson in accordance with the curriculum.

Program staff will be of assistance for support with lesson planning if needed.
If a mentee is between phases, such as mentee needs a little from Phase 1 & 2, then the mentor will combine parts of each of the phases to fit the mentee's needs.
