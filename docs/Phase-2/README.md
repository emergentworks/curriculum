# Web Development

In an effort to respect the time of both mentors and mentees, we're recommending a default curriculum that
builds a solid foundation for technical skills while introducing the fundamental technologies for Web Development.

In your mentor/mentee journey you may very well decide that this curriculum is not
the appropriate path, and that's fine.

[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) is a "High quality coding education created by an Open-Source community."

What we like about the Odin Project is that they are not attempting to do everything themselves. There
is a sizable community working to build a solid curriculum that references
some of the best sources on the Internet.

> Coincidentally, this is what we set out to do, and discovered that
> it has already been done and is actively maintained by far more resources than we have to commit to a similar endeavor.

Their [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) path seems especially well-suited
to an introduction to Web Development.

Be sure to walk through the [Introduction](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), [Installations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#installations), and [Git Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#git-basics) sections.

> Note: You may find that you need a bit of mentoring in navigating these sections.  
> They do not provide the, "open a web site and start reading a editing a quick example" experience that
> some web sites provide, but it should be time well spent.

## HTML and CSS

After covering the setup in the first three sections, the following sections
provide a good introduction to HTML and CSS:

- [HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations)
- [CSS Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#css-foundations)
- [Flexbox](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#flexbox)

## JavaScript

With that foundation, the [JavaScript Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics) section does an excelllent job of
introducing JavaScript (and unlike many JavaScript focused curriculums, includes integration
into web pages along with the language foundation)
