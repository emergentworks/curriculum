# Phase 3 - Intro to Programming

This is EW's Phase 3 Mentee Curriculum during the 12 weeks mentorship.
Phase 3 consists of 3 Modules, with each module being 4 weeks.

During the mentorship, the mentor is expected to utilize the Phase 3 curriculum and
adjust the pace of it according to their mentee's needs.

In the curriculum, the mentor will find hyperlinked resources that they can use.

Note: The "Final Project" assignment is to "Replicate your favorite website as close as possible".  
This is your Passion Project, so don't feel constrained to this directive.  
DO show us what you've learned.  This is your chance to "show off"

### Knowledge Check Deliverables
As you progress through the Odin Project lessons, many lessons wrap up with a "Knowledge Check"
As you encounter each of these, please create a markdown document in GitHub containing your answers to
these questions.  If a question asks you to write code, then place that code in a separate *.js file in your repo
and link to it as your answer in the markdown file.  For these deliverables, we'll provide a way for you to share 
a link to the markdown file answering these questions.

Many assignments involved reading and watching resources, and, as such, have no actual deliverables.  
These assignments should still be completed.

### Note

This is the first time that we are using The Odin Project's JavaScript Course directly.  
The breakdown of modules into 4-week segments is, currently, a "reasonable guess" at how to
progress through this curriculum, with the intent of completion in 12 weeks.  We welcome, and appreciate
any feedback as to whether we've broken it up appropriately, and the feasibility of completing these
lessons in the time allotted.  

Program staff will be of assistance for support with lesson planning if needed.

If a mentee is between phases, such as mentee needs a little from Phase 1 & 2, then the mentor will combine parts of each of the phases to fit the mentee's needs.

### Mentee Starting Skill Level

- Familiarity with an object-oriented programming language (JavaScript)
- Proficiency in HTML and CSS
