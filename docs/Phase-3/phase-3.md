# Phase 3 - Intro to Programming

This is EW's Phase 3 Mentee Curriculum during the 12 weeks mentorship.
Phase 3 consists of 3 Modules, with each module being 4 weeks.

The Phase 3 curriculum follows The Odin Project's <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript Course</a>

During the mentorship, the mentor is expected to utilize the Phase 3 curriculum and
adjust the pace of it according to their mentee's needs.

In the curriculum, the mentor will find hyperlinked resources that they can use.

### Knowledge Check Deliverables
As you progress through the Odin Project lessons, many lessons wrap up with a "Knowledge Check"
As you encounter each of these, please create a markdown document in GitHub containing your answers to
these questions.  If a question asks you to write code, then place that code in a separate *.js file in your repo
and link to it as your answer in the markdown file.  For these deliverables, we'll provide a way for you to share 
a link to the markdown file answering these questions.

Many assignments involved reading and watching resources, and, as such, have no actual deliverables.  
These assignments should still be completed.

### Note

This is the first time that we are using The Odin Project's JavaScript Course directly.  
The breakdown of modules into 4-week segments is, currently, a "reasonable guess" at how to
progress through this curriculum, with the intent of completion in 12 weeks.  We welcome, and appreciate
any feedback as to whether we've broken it up appropriately, and the feasibility of completing these
lessons in the time allotted.  

If you find you're finishing a module early, then, let us know, and move on.
If you need more than 4 weeks to complete a module, then take the necessary time to cover the material thoroughly.
Don't rush ahead to the next module just to "stay on schedule"
You'll be much better served to have completed X% with good comprehension, than you will be having moved on
just to complete everything in 12 weeks.

All feedback on what is a reasonable pace for this course will be incorporated into the plans for future cohorts.

### Mentee Starting Skill Level

- Familiarity with an object-oriented programming language (JavaScript)
- Proficiency in HTML and CSS
- Completion of The Odin Project's <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations" target="_blank">Foundations Course</a> will be especially useful.  
Though, not necessary, you may also find it a valuable resource if you struggle on portions of Phase 3.
