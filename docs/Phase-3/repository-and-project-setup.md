# Repository and Project Setup

- Set up your repository
  - Go to the [EmergentWorks phase-3-assignments](https://github.com/emergentworks/phase-3-assignments) repository template.
  - Click on "Use this template" (option "Create a new repository")

  - When the "Create a new repository from phase-3-assignments" pop-up appears:
    - Select your gitHub account
    - Assign a repository name 
    - Keep your new repo "Public"
    - Click the "Include all branches" checkbox (this will copy the "mentee" branch that's important for issue links to work)

  - When the "Make a Copy" pop-up appears:
    - Select "Draft issues will be copied if selected" (this is important, as all tasks are set up as "draft issues")
    - Set your GitHub account as the "Owner" (you'll probably want this to be the Mentee's account)
    - Name the Project as you desire (I just removed the "[copy]" text)
