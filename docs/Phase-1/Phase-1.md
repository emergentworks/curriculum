# Phase 1 - Digital Literacy

This is EW's Phase 1 Mentee Curriculum during the 12 weeks mentorship.
Phase 1 consists of 3 Modules, with each module being 4 weeks.

During the mentorship, the mentor is expected to utilize the Phase 1 curriculum and adjust the pace of it according to their mentee's needs.

In the curriculum, the mentor will find hyperlinked resources that they can use.
A <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zxx33pMIud3dbVyI-OS6yUb64AkhTxDSpJbNCj7lftE/edit" target="_blank" class="external">lesson plan template</a> is available to mentors and can be used to structure each lesson in accordance with the curriculum.

Program staff will be of assistance for support with lesson planning if needed.

If a mentee is between phases, perhaps a mentee needs a little from Phase 1 & 2, then the mentor will combine parts of each
of the phases to fit the mentee's needs.
