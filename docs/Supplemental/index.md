# Supplemental / Alternative resources

There will frequently be reasons why the default curriculum is not
optimum for a given mentee. The Odin project does reference good supplemental
materials, but here is a place for us to gather additional resources that might

## Contribution Note

We want to be continuously respectful of both mentor and mentee time. If
you have a resource to suggest, we _really_ appreciate it. There's, no doubt,
a reason why you feel the resource is valuable. When you submit a suggestion, please provide
a brief description of the resource, what it's value is, and any caveats that
a mentor/mentee should be aware of.

If you do make use of one of these resources, everyone would probably appreciate the
addition of a brief review describing your experience utilizing that resource.

We'll accept suggestions wither through quick notes to the #curriculum channel on the
EmergentWorks Slack, or you can use you're (perhaps newfound) GitHub skills to
submit a PR to this page.
