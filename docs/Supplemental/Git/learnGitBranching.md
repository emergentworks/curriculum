# Learning Git Branching (game)

<a href="https://learngitbranching.js.org/" target="_blank" class="external">Learning Git Branching (game)</a>

## Pros:

Nice graphical presentation of Git commits, branching, etc.

Game challenges can be fun and make git commands a bit more approachable.

## Cons:

Some concepts could use a bit more elaboration. They pretty much give you
just enough to solve the challenge. A bit short on details.

Careful if you go too far into the challenges. It wanders into areas where
"git angels" fear to tread. They can be fun challenges, but don't think
that you don't know Git well enough if you don't really internalize some
of the advanced stuff. (They'd probably get you in "hot water" in some shops
anyway)
