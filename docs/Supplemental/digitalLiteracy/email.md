# Email

This unit goes over the basics of email, using gmail specifically as the email provider because it's a free service and well-documented. It's assumed that your mentee already has an email because the online mentorship requires one, but you can walk through any of the email activities below with your mentee to strengthen their proficiency.

For creating an email account, we recommend using <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount" target="_blank">gmail</a>.

Instructions on creating an email account can be found <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/56256?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.

Since Gmail is well documented on the internet, here are additional resources for topics that you can walk through with your mentee if they have questions:<br>
