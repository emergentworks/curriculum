# An Interactive Guide to Flexbox

<a href="https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=wdrl-306" target="blank">An Interactive Guide to Flexbox</a>

## Pros:

A really nice guide to FlexBox.  Examples include graphical displays of the results and the ability to interact with 
them to see how they change the rendering.  Excellent addition of visual resources to reinforce the material.

## Cons:

Not sure why, but there's a bit of screen "jitter" when I pull this up on Safari.  (It doesn't happen on Chrome.)
