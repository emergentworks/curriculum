      <p>My New Year's resolution for 2018 is to <strong>read more non-social-media content</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>I feel like there are a lot of really good books and magazines I am missing out on 
          because of how much time I spend on social media, so this year I am going to actively
          try to diversify my content consumption.</p>
