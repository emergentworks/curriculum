    <h1>Welcome to my New Year's Resolution app!</h1>
 
    <main>
      
      <p>My New Year's resolution for 2018 is to <strong>read more non-social-media content</strong>.</p>
      
      <p>I feel like there are a lot of really good books and magazines I am missing out on 
          because of how much time I spend on social media, so this year I am going to actively
          try to diversify my content consumption.</p>
      
      <p>The cool thing about New Year's resolutions is that they are a social construct, and 
          whether it's being achieved or not depends entirely on the individual. If I miss a day,
          I can make it up in other ways, so I will try to remember that so I don't stress myself 
          out over tracking :)
