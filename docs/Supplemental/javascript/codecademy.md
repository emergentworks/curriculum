# Codecademy

## Pros:

Courses tend to be very accessible (easy to get started and provide a
quick remedy to apprehension a mentee might have about something being "too hard").
You can work through the material in-browser without any local setup.

## Cons:

Quizzes and projects are "Pro" features and are not free.

Many of the "cons" for Free Code Camp apply here as well, as both
take a pretty similar approach.
