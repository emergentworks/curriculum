# Exercism

Exercism has a guided <a href="https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/concepts" target="_blank" class="external">syllabus</a> for learning
JavaScript. Each lesson is accompanied by an exercise to complete to demonstrate
comprehension of the material. Exercises can be completed in an in-browser editor, or
can be downloaded to complete locally, and the student can upload the results to have
their work checked and progress tracked. (Recommend following the <a href="https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/javascript/installation" target="_blank">installation</a>
link and working locally. The local development experience will be valuable.)

> Recommend this as a source for mentors picking exercises to reinforce learning.

## Pros:

There is some flexibility in the students selection of the path through the syllabus, but 
where there is prerequisite material, you'll need to complete it before moving on. This is pretty nice.

All exercises are evaluated using Jest unit tests so the student gets some experience with Test Driven Development.

Even if you don't follow the syllabus path, you can pick exercises from a large list
of exercises (as of this writing there are 139 of them) ranging from easy to difficult.

It can be a rich source of material to reinforce your understanding of a language.

## Cons:

I don't think it's a substitute for the Odin project in the breadth of the
material that is covered, and some material introducing topics can be pretty "brief"

Also, as you progress into the exercises there is a broad range in the "quality" of the exercises. Some
can be a bit difficult to interpret, thought the unit tests can clarify things.
