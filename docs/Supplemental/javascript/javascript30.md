These are well done tutorials from Wes Bos, a very good instructor. Many of his
classes are purchases, but these little tutorials are free, fun, and
result in very nice, demo web sites. Along the way, you'll learn a few tricks,
but also get a feel for the breadth of things that can be done with JavaScript on a
web page with "No Frameworks×No Compilers×No Libraries×No Boilerplate"

You'll want some familiarity with JavaScript and it's use on Web Pages before
using these tutorials. Consider them "candy" of sorts.

They are generally short tutorials that start with nicely designed resources
and work the student through some fun projects that demonstrate
JavaScript integration enhanced web page interaction.
