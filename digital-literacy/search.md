# Internet Search

This unit goes over the basics of using Google search and how to evaluate information on the internet. There are fewer activities for pairing in this unit, so for this lesson, we recommend that both mentor & mentee read through these docs ahead of time, and discuss any questions that come up during a meeting.

## Activities

Have your mentee pick a topic or news story they want to know more about. Have them look up information on multiple sites (at least 2). Can they identify the authors of the articles and when they were last updated? Are there differences in how the information is presented? Can they identify any details that differ from one article to another? Based on their findings, which website seems to be the most credible and why?

Have your mentee look up directions to get to/from 3 different places on Google maps; have them look up directions for public transportation/biking/walking/driving.

Have your mentee use Google to search for a service they've been looking for (barber/mechanic/how to get a library card) and compare results.

Are there times when you've read something online that you later found out to be misinformation? How did you learn that the information was correct? Did it change which sources you trusted for news and how you evaluate things you see posted online?
