# Supplemental / Alternative resources

There will frequently be reasons why the default curriculum is not
optimum for a given mentee. The Odin project does reference good supplemental
materials, but here is a place for us to gather additional resources that might
prove useful. (I you want to suggest additions please see the [note](#contribution-note) below.)

## JavaScript

### freeCodeCamp

#### Pros:

Free Code Camp courses tend to be very accessible (easy to get started and provide a
quick remedy to apprehension a mentee might have about something being
"too hard"). You can work through the material in-browser without any local setup.
Pursued completely, their courses to provide a pretty thorough coverage of the material.

The material is well indexed, and it's easy to drill straight into their coverage
of a single topic. This can be useful if you're just looking for "another explanation"

#### Cons:

The integrated editor that allows you to get started quickly is good and bad. It
is not how you'll actually work on projects and this is a lot of material to
have covered without configuring and setting up some sort of development environment.

While early sessions are easy to work through, and can give you that "I can do this"
experience that everyone needs getting started, you should manage expectations. Material
is covered briefly, with a short (in-browser) test that you understood the thing you just read.
You should expect that there will be something of a "rude realization" that you don't
really recall all of the material covered. This is _normal_ for the way the material is covered.
It provides a basic exposure, but you will have to go back and look up things that were
covered.

  > The JavaScript curriculum is notably lacking in any sort of DOM interaction. This can result
  > in quite a lengthy period of learning JavaScript, without connecting it back to
  > how it's going to tie back into what you've learned about HTML and CSS and can improve
  > your web pages.

### Code Academy

#### Pros:

Courses tend to be very accessible (easy to get started and provide a
quick remedy to apprehension a mentee might have about something being "too hard").
You can work through the material in-browser without any local setup.

#### Cons:

Quizzes and projects are "Pro" features and are not free.

Many of the "cons" for Free Code Camp apply here as well, as both
take a pretty similar approach.

### Exercism

Exercism has a guided [syllabus](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/concepts) for learning
JavaScript. Each lesson is accompanied by an exercise to complete to demonstrate
comprehension of the material. Exercises can be completed in an in-browser editor, or
can be downloaded to complete locally, and the student can upload the results to have
their work checked and progress tracked. (Recommend following the [installation](https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/javascript/installation)
link and working locally. The local development experience will be valuable.)

> Recommend this as a source for mentors picking exercises to reinforce learning.

#### Pros:

There is some flexibility in the students selection of the path through the syllabus, but there
where there is prerequisite material, you'll need to complete it before moving on. This is pretty nice.

All exercises are evaluated using Jest unit tests so the student gets some experience with Test Driven Development.

Even if you don't follow the syllabus path, you can pick exercises from a large list
of exercises (as of this writing there are 139 of them) ranging from easy to difficult.

It can be a rich source of material to reinforce your understanding of a language.

#### Cons:

I don't think it's a substitute for the Odin project in the breadth of the
material that is covered, and some material introducing topics can be pretty "brief"

Also, as you progress into the exercises there is a broad range in the "quality" of the exercises. Some
can be a bit difficult to interpret, thought the unit tests can clarify things.

### JavaScript30

[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com)

> Note: This is actually part of the practice section of [DOM MANIPULATION AND EVENTS](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-dom-manipulation-and-events)
> in The Odin Project curriculum

These are well done tutorials from Wes Bos, a very good instructor. Many of his
classes are purchases, but these little tutorials are free, fun, and
result in very nice, demo web sites. Along the way, you'll learn a few tricks,
but also get a feel for the breadth of things that can be done with JavaScript on a
web page with "No Frameworks×No Compilers×No Libraries×No Boilerplate"

You'll want some familiarity with JavaScript and it's use on Web Pages before
using these tutorials. Consider them "candy" of sorts.

They are generally short tutorials that start with nicely designed resources
and work the student through some fun projects that demonstrate
JavaScript integration enhanced web page interaction.

## Git

### [Learning Git Branching (game)](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

#### Pros:

Nice graphical presentation of Git commits, branching, etc.

Game challenges can be fun and make git commands a bit more approachable.

#### Cons:

Some concepts could use a bit more elaboration. They pretty much give you
just enough to solve the challenge. A bit short on details.

Careful if you go too far into the challenges. It wanders into areas where
"git angels" fear to tread. They can be fun challenges, but don't think
that you don't know Git well enough if you don't really internalize some
of the advanced stuff. (They'd probably get you in "hot water" in some shops
anyway)

## Contribution Note

We want to be continuously respectful for both mentor and mentee time. If
you have a resource to suggest, we _really_ appreciate it. There's, no doubt,
a reason why you feel the resource is valuable. When you submit a suggestion, please provide
a brief description of the resource, what it's value is, and any caveats that
a mentor/mentee should be aware of.

If you do make use of one of these resources, everyone would probably appreciate the
addition of a brief review describing your experience utilizing that resource.

We'll accept suggestions wither through quick notes to the #curriculum channel on the
EmergentWorks Slack, or you can use you're (perhaps newfound) GitHub skills to
submit a PR to this page.
