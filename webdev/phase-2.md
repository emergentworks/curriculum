Phase 2 consists of 3 Modules, with each module being 4 weeks. During the mentorship, it is expected of mentor to utilize the Phase 2 curriculum and adjust the pace of it according to their mentee's needs. In the curriculum, mentor will find hyperlinked resources that they can use. Mentors will also be provided with a [lesson plan template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zxx33pMIud3dbVyI-OS6yUb64AkhTxDSpJbNCj7lftE/edit) that can be used to structure each lesson in accordance with the curriculum.
