# Web Development

In an effort to respect the time of both mentors and mentees, we're recommending a default curriculum that
builds a solid foundation for technical skills while introducing the fundamental technologies for Web Development.

In your mentor/mentee journey you may very well decide that this curriculum is not
the appropriate path, and that's fine.

<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a> is a "High quality coding education created by an Open-Source community."

What we like about the Odin Project is that they are not attempting to do everything themselves. There
is a sizable community working to build a solid curriculum that references
some of the best sources on the Internet.

> Coincidentally, this is what we set out to do, and discovered that
> it has already been done and is actively maintained by far more resources than we have to commit to a similar endevor)

Their <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations" target="_blank">Foundations</a> path seems especially well-suited
to an introduction to Web Development.

Be sure to walk through the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations" target="_blank">Introduction</a>, [Installations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#installations), and [Git Basics](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#git-basics) sections.

> Note: You may find that you need a bit of mentoring in navigating these sections.  
> They do not provide the, "open a web site and start reading a editing a quick example" experience that
> some web sites provide, but it should be time well spent.

## HTML and CSS

After covering the setup in the first three sections, the following sections
provide a good introduction to HTML and CSS:

- <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations" target="_blank">HTML Foundations</a>
- <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#css-foundations" target="_blank">CSS Foundations</a>
- <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#flexbox" target="_blank">Flexbox</a>

## JavaScript

With that foundation, the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics" target="_blank">JavaScript Basics</a> section does an excelllent job of
introducing JavaScript (and unlike many JavaScript focused curriculums, includes integration
into web pages along with the language foundation)
