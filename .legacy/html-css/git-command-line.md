# Git + Command Line 101

### Objectives

The mentee should get comfortable using Git and GitHub; specifically pushing commits to their repository. We don’t need to introduce the concept of branches and multiple contributors just yet. This activity will mainly help them get comfortable with git commands and making commits.

This is meant to be done in parallel with the mentee's personal website. Therefore, keep in mind not to overwhelm them with too many new information.

### Pre-requisite

Make sure the mentee has Git installed on their computer. Depending on their operating system and computer model, they may already have Git installed. For some versions of Mac, they will need to install XCode which will involve a long downloading process (and free space). Help them navigate the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Instructions

While working on the personal website project (or any other project), have them make commits to their repository using their terminal window. A way you can introduce Git to them:

1. What is VCS (Version Control System)? Help them understand by relating this to something they are familiar with like having Google Docs’ history, drafts in Microsoft Word, editing music, or editing videos and photos.
2. Emphasize the difference between Git and GitHub. No need to go in depth about open source just yet; just enough for them to understand that code can be hosted and accessed anywhere on GitHub.
3. Help them create a GitHub account.
4. Initialize their personal website project as a git repository and teach them how to add and commit files.
   1. It helps to go over terms like repository, commit, diff, push, pull, upstream, etc.
   2. Either choose to teach them how to use git from the command line or from a UI. Here are some trade-offs:
    * Git on the command line:
        * Benefits:
            * Get experience using the command line
            * Feel more confident over the VCS of their project
        * Disadvantages:
            * Higher learning curve
            * May feel overwhelmed with the amount of new content; especially when doing this while learning HTML
    * [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is a good UI for beginners to start with, but feel free to choose one for the mentee.
5. Show them how you can view different versions of their repo in GitHub. They can also refer to what was added and removed from a commit.
6. If the mentee feels challenged and is comfortable with Git, introduce the structure of the command line.
    * Cover these terms like arguments and flags
    * Make sure they understand that “enter” means executing a line.
    * You can go over these commands with [this activity](https://glitch.com/~bash-house) (just “remix” or duplicate the project and use the Glitch terminal to complete the activity). Follow the instructions markdown file for more details.
