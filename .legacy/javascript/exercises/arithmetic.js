// PART TWO: Variables and Expressions
// write an expression with two variables, x and y, that adds two numbers together.
// if x is 238 and y is 9,271, what does the expression evaluate to?
// print the answer to the console

// write an expression with three variables, a, b and c, that adds a and b together,
// then divides the answer by c.

// print the answer to the console

// write an expression with three variables, d, e and f, that subtracts d from e,
// then multiplies the result by z.
// if d is 87, e is 27 and f is 4, what does the expression evaluate to?
// bonus: if you decrement the total, what does the expression evaluate to?
// what happens to the original value?
// print the answer to the console
