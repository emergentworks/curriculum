// TYPES (and mutability)

// PRIMITIVES
// Strings
// print a string to the console that says "Hello, [your name]!"
// assign your name to a variable and print the same string to the console using concatenation

// write any string you want and assign it to a variable, then print the variable to the console
// check if the variable you just created is a string with the typeof operator

// Numbers
// print any number to the console
// assign the number to a variable, then print the variable to the console
// check if the variable you just created is a number with the typeof operator
// for more exercises using numbers, go to the arithmetic.js exercises

// Symbols
// Side note: personally I don't find myself using this type very often in JS, but wanted to
// include it because it is a data type
// Because Symbols are used to create/represent a unique identifier, they're good for creating
// records that need a unique ID. Pretend that we're trying to create an ID for a new user to
// register with the Not 911 app. Using a Symbol, assign a unique value to a variable to represent
// the new user's ID. 
// Print the value to the console.

// Booleans
// Do you have any siblings? Assign your answer to a boolean variable and print it to the console.
// check if the variable you just created is a boolean with the typeof operator
// Assign the number of siblings you have to a variable; check if this number is greater than 3

// Undefined
// This is where we see mutability in action!
// Initialize a variable called userName without a value, then print it to the console
// Now assign your name to the variable and print it to the console. 
// Did the value change? Why?

// STRUCTURAL
// Objects
// create an object with some information about you stored in key-value pairs, such as your name, 
// your age, where you live, what your favorite coding language is so far, etc
// print the object to the console
// check the data type of your object with the typeof operator

// Arrays
// Arrays have a whole exercise file unto themselves, so this is just a very basic example.
// create an array with a collection of colors
// print the array to the console
// check the data type of your array with the typeof operator
// Hint: Arrays are a typeof object, so you might need to google around for some other methods
// to confirm the type

// Functions
// Functions have a whole exercise file unto themselves, so this is just a very basic example.
// Write a function named printName that prints your name to the console.
// Invoke the function to make sure it prints your name
// check if the function you just created is a function data type with the typeof operator

// STRUCTURAL ROOT PRIMITIVE
// Null
// We use null when we're checking for the value of something that may or may not be valid.
// This often comes up when we're receiving input or data. For example, if a field in a form is optional
// and a user does not answer, the value might be stored as null.
// Null is the only value for a null object, so I don't really have any exercises here, just wanted to
// make sure it made the list of JS types. Often it comes up as something like this psuedo code:
// if name is not null/empty
//   print name
// else
//   print "no name on record"
// end

// CONCEPTUAL QUESTIONS
// Alex is looking at the weather and it's raining outside. Should she bring an umbrella? What kind
// of data type would you use for this answer? / What value could you assign to the variable 
// needsUmbrella for Alex?

// Lynn is filling out a form on a website; it has a section for comments and questions. What kind of 
// data type is the message she adds to the form?

// Donald is making an appointment online. It's going to be a 30 minute appointment. What kind of 
// data type is the length of time for the appointment?

// Desir√©e is looking up books in the catalog of her local library online. Each search result contains a
// title, author, date of publication and availability. What data type do you think this information is stored in?
// Bonus: what data types are used for the title, author, date of publication and availability?
