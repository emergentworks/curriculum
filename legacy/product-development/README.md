# Product Development

*Emergent Works students build technology solutions to
the problems that affect them and their communities.*

This document outlines a recommended approach to developing your class project, aka. your product.

_**Your class project: A website that addresses a problem you
have identified in your community.**_

## 1. The Problem (Why?)

The first step to building your project is to **start
with the problem**. Pick a problem that you have identified and
make sure you understand it.

There are a few ways to understand a problem:
* Observe it
* Talk with the users experiencing it
* Find market research about it

**You should try to become an expert on the problem!**

Once you have chosen a problem, you should be able to answer the following questions:
* What is the problem you are trying to solve?
* Why is this problem happening?
* Who does this problem affect?
* What do they need to solve the problem and why?
* Why is this problem important to you?

## 2. The Solution (What?)

Once we have identified a problem we want to solve, we
can ideate a solution.

### Brainstorm solutions

Your first idea may is not always the best one! Take some time to brainstorm multiple solutions. You can ask others for help!
Try coming up with **at least 5 ideas**.

### Define the solution

Once you are done brainstorming, choose a solution that:
* You believe will address the problem
* You can build in a reasonable amount of time
* You feel passionately about

You should be able to clearly describe your solution with
a sentence that starts with **"A website that..."**.

## 3. Minimum Viable Product (What?)

A **Minimum Viable Product (or MVP)** is a product with just
enough functionality to get the job done and test with users. Improvements can be made later.

We start with an MVP because one of the most important principles in building technology
is to **launch fast and iterate**.

In order to get our product out to users as quickly as possible,
we set the scope of our MVP and stick to it.

The scope of our MVP will be defined by:
* A list of features
  * The user will be able to...
* A list of pages (can be 1 page)
  * eg. Home page, about page,...
* Wireframes for each page (and optionally user flows)

### Set the scope of your MVP

* Create a list of features for your website
  * On this website, the user will be able to...
* From the list of features, decide how many pages your website will have. Your website may just have 1 page!
  * Example: YouTube MVP might have 3 pages (Home page, search page, video page)
* For each page, make a list of the what will go on the page
  * Example: YouTube video page - video, video title, video author, comments, similar videos
* Make wireframes for all the pages of your MVP with pen and paper (you should use 1 piece of paper per page)
  * Optionally, you can create them with https://wireframe.com afterwards

## 4. Project Planning (How?)

Once we have set the scope of our MVP, we can start planning how we will build our project.

### Write a Tech Spec

A **tech spec** is a document that helps you plan out your code
before you start coding. It details the approach you will take to building your project.

Your tech spec should answer the following questions:
* What technologies and/or languages will you use?
* List all the files you will need to create.
* What are some challenges you anticipate running into?
* Is there any complex logic? Plan it out with pseudocode or diagrams.
* How long do you think it will take to build each page/feature?
* Do you have any questions about how to start?

### Set Weekly Goals

Setting and keeping track of goals is the best way to finish
a project in time.

With your mentor, make a list of coding goals for the upcoming
weeks. Start with what is most important (HTML, must-have content, core functionality) and end with nice-to-haves (design tweaks, cool animations, details).

Keep track of your weekly goals your [Team Progress Tracking document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cO_27t2KBDFA3bzAn-YGNKSsk9_1L3XDVLHDAg7jn4c/edit).

### [Example] Weekly Goals

### Beware of Scope Creep

Scope creep is what happens when we add to the scope of our
project after we have started building it. There may
be some good reasons to add to our MVP, but in general, we
heavily discourage this.

Beware of scope creep! When in doubt, ask yourself: **"Is this a Minimum Viable Product feature?"**

## 5. Start Coding!
