# Personal Website Project

### Objective

There are two parts to this project. 1. Create a website to display your internet identity as well as your future projects. 2. Host your website on `<your_username>.github.io` so if your GitHub username is foo123, you will be able to access your web page on `https://foo123.github.io`.

You are not limited to these instructions. You are free to make as many pages or use any resources as you want. These objectives serve as a foundation to your coding journey.

This project is made to take at least 4 weeks to complete. Explore different elements and styles in HTML and CSS. If the mentee feels comfortable with HTML and CSS, they are free to start including Javascript into their personal website.

## Part 1

### Objective

Create a single-page web page using HTML and CSS. It should at least be accessible on the mentee’s computer browser.

### Instructions
Create a personal website that features:
   Your name or nickname
* Where in the world you’re based in (ex. New York City).
* A photo that represents you. It could be a picture of yourself or your favorite movie character.
* *Optional*: Links to your social media. +1 if you can link them to their social media icons.

## Part 2

### Objective

Create a second page for your website and link it to your first web page. Then, host it on GitHub.

### Pre-requisite
* GitHub account. Simply create one on [www.github.com](www.github.com)

### Instructions

Create a second page to your website. This will act as an “about” page. Add the following:
* Some of your hobbies, interests, and anything else you would like the world to know about.
* A list of things you would like to learn how to build with code. This can be in a bulleted list.
* A link to an article or video that you believe everyone should read or watch. (ex. [Crying in HMart article](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/crying-in-h-mart))

You can simply follow the instructions [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/web-development-tools/a/hosting-your-website-on-github) to learn how to create a repository in your GitHub account and host your files there.
